**Chester**
The Chester program is a minimax based chess engine created using assembly 8086.
It can be ran on DOSBOX with the necessary run files.
The engine can calculate about 3 moves forward in reasonable time.

When executing the program a chess GUI will be opened, the human is down and Chester is above, 50% chance to start as white.

**Game**
A 1v1 game made in c# player1 using arrows and player2 WASD.

**NeuralNetworks**
A neural network made without libraries (except numpy) that can identify patterns, as of right now the "saved_weights.npz" file contains weights and biases that correspond with the EMNIST database. 
Upon running the program a small pygame window will appear, in there you can draw your letter or number and press enter, the network will forward pass the input and predict a number in the internal terminal.

The network of course can be trained with other inputs and truths so it can match your project.
